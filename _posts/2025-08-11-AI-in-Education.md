## Introduction to Prompt Engineering

If you‚Äôve ever chatted with ChatGPT or asked an AI tool to create a picture, you‚Äôve already dipped your toes into prompt engineering‚Äîeven if you didn‚Äôt realize it! 
Prompt engineering sounds fancy, but it‚Äôs simply the skill of crafting clear and effective instructions (or ‚Äúprompts‚Äù) to get the best possible responses from artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

## Prompting Techniques for Any Generative AI

When writing prompts for tools like Claude, Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini, always try to include these four components at the beginning of your prompt chat:

1.  **Role:** Define the role the AI should play (e.g., "You are a tech-savvy person and a history teacher...").
2.  **Goal:** State the specific task you want the AI to accomplish (e.g., "Give me a lesson plan...").
3.  **Context:** Provide the necessary background information for the question (e.g., "The students are 10th graders...").
4.  **Format:** Specify how you want the response to be structured (e.g., "Give me in an Excel format...").
5.  **Example (optional):** To show the pattern you want, you can say, "The pattern is:..."

**Key Rule:** Always start a new chat for a new topic to keep the context clean.

## Prompt Examples

* **Flashcard Prompt for EXCEL Format:**
If you need Flashcard in a certain format that you want, instead of copy pasting to do your bulk upload, you can ask the GenAI to create that format for you. Imagine this in any given scenario:
    * **Prompt:** `You are a tech savvy person and a <xyz subject Teacher>. create flashcard for flashcard machine website import option. here is the entire content of flashcards: ‚Äú<paste your topic content here, inside the double quotes >‚Äù. Ensure the flashcards MUST be in EXCEL format. For example, the first term must be in row 1, column 1, and its definition in row 1, column 2.`

* **Lesson Plan Prompt for NoteBookLM (after uploading a textbook):**
    * **Prompt:** `Generate a lesson plan for chapter 1, for pages between 1 and 56: follow BLOOMS taxonomy. make sure to include enrichment activities.`

* **Quiz Worksheet Prompt for NoteBookLM (to extract questions from specific content):**
    * **Prompt:** `Generate 10 MCQ style questions from the attached book, chapter 1 between pages 1 and page 56: make sure to give answers only at the end.`
